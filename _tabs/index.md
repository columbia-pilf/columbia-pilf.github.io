# PILF
PILF advocates for the use of legal education in the public
service as a method of enriching the communities in which we live
as well as the careers and personal lives of law students and
lawyers. Our student-led non-profit is seeking out energetic law
students who seek to be active in their communities, be that
fulltime or through valuable pro bono work.

PILF believes it should be easier for law students to engage in
public interest work, while in law school and after graduation, in
all capacities---government jobs, corporate work, non-profit
employment---and we are determined to meet that challenge.

We are an independent non-profit organization, but more
importantly, we are a community of law students and alumni devoted
to public interest advocacy. We are unique from other student
groups in the leadership opportunities we provide to law students,
as well as in the access we offer to legal practitioners and
alumni.

## Guaranteed Summer Funding!

For the last four years, PILF has seen the fruition of many previous years of efforts: the law school [now offers](http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2007/january2007/publicinterest) guaranteed summer funding for public interest work to all students. Of course, this guarantee is dependant on PILF's continued financial support. We are thrilled about this announcement.
