# Get Involved with PILF

Regardless of whether you are currently at Columbia, we
encourage you to get involved with PILF. There are opportunities
for involvement by students, alumni, faculty, firms, and others who
would like to be Friends of PILF.

If you have any questions about joining PILF, please [send us an email.](mailto:pilf@law.columbia.edu)

## Students

**Membership:** While PILF events and activities are open to all law students, joining PILF allows members to run for board positions and to come to PILF's Annual Dinner. Membership is thirty dollars for one year or fifty dollars for all three years and all new members receive a cool PILF t-shirt. 

**Community Grants**: PILF makes annual grants to legal organizations that are doing outstanding public interest work. Be a part of the important decision making process and learn about amazing legal work going on around the world! Contact [Rachael Siegel](mailto:PILF.Grants@gmail.com) for more information.

**Student Events**: PILF hosts mixers, panels on all kinds of topics, and fora to get to know alumni and practitioners. Have a great idea? Help us plan some great events for the upcoming year.  [Email us](mailto:pilf@law.columbia.edu) for more details.

**Fundraising**: Last year PILF raised over $100,000 through various fundraising initiatives!

*   We host an upscale Annual Dinner each fall to honor an individual who has made significant contributions to public interest work.  Contact Dinner VPs [Stephen Yanni](mailto:stephen.yanni@law.columbia.edu) and [Sarah Chen](mailto:weiyang.chen@law.columbia.edu) to help plan this incredible event.
*   PILF coordinates an Annual Auction each spring, our biggest bash of the year! Donate services and goods, help plan the big night, and make sure to bid!
*   PILF supports the Dean's Cup basketball game, held in late spring, and is a recipient of funds raised from this awesome night. Be a volunteer at the big game and root for Columbia!
*   Help run PILF's bookstore of used law books (it's a much better deal than the campus bookstore!)

## Alumni

Columbia Law School Alumni are always encouraged to join PILF as Alumni members, whether they were involved with PILF during their law school days or not. Suggested contributions to support and join PILF are $40 for Alumni in public interest practice and $150 for Alumni in private practice.

Alumni are also encouraged to contribute their time by being an Alumni member of the PILF Board and/or contributing items for the Annual PILF Auction. Alumni are, as always, welcome to attend and take part in both the Dinner and Auction. We would love to see you there!

## Faculty

Columbia Law School Faculty are also more than welcome to join the PILF family, as a member or as a Board representative. We suggest a contribution of $100 for Faculty to support and join PILF.

Law School Faculty are also extremely instrumental to the success of the Annual Auction. Items donated by Faculty are perennial favorites and Faculty members themselves are always very popular auctioneers.

## Firms

Law firms can show their support for PILF in several ways. Firms are welcome to help sponsor the PILF Dinner (and to encourage their attorneys to buy tickets to attend the Dinner); to donate tickets to events, dinners, or any other appropriate items to the PILF Auction; and to match Columbia Law School summer associates' donations to the PILF Summer Salary Drive.

## Friends of PILF

Finally, anyone can join the Friends of PILF circle for $200.  Friends of PILF are recognized for their generosity and support for public interest in the PILF Dinner and Auction Programs and the Annual Newsletter.
