### About the Dinner
Since 1991, PILF's Annual Dinner has brought together Columbia Law School alumni, faculty, students, and New York-area lawyers to present the Public Interest Achievement Award to an individual who has made significant contributions to public interest law. The Annual Dinner is underwritten by law firms and friends of PILF. All net proceeds support fellowships for student summer work and PILF's Community Grants program.

### About PILF: 

PILF is an independent nonprofit organization and community of law students and alumni devoted to public interest advocacy. Since our inception in 1980, PILF has provided more than $1 million in grants to fund community-based legal services.
